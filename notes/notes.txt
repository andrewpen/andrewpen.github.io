The server generated these startup warnings when booting:
        2021-03-16T21:34:38.818-05:00: Access control is not enabled for the database. Read and write access to data and configuration is unrestricted
        2021-03-16T21:34:38.818-05:00: This server is bound to localhost. Remote systems will be unable to connect to this server.

        Enable MongoDB's free cloud-based monitoring service, which will then receive and display
        metrics about your deployment (disk utilization, CPU, operation statistics, etc).

        The monitoring data will be available on a MongoDB website with a unique URL accessible to you
        and anyone you share the URL with. MongoDB may use this information to make product
        improvements and to suggest MongoDB products and deployment options to you.

        To enable free monitoring, run the following command: db.enableFreeMonitoring()
        To permanently disable this reminder, run the following command: db.disableFreeMonitoring()

What is it that you want?
Make it trackable - you need to be able to see the finishline.
Why do you want to achieve that goal?
Find who has achieved this before and model them.
Determine what needs to be done - the tasks and milestones that will get you there.
What is the date you want to achieve this by? Needs a deadline - end date.
What routines will get you there - schedule and action 
Reflection time once a week to say how did I do, what needs to change, what needs to continue
